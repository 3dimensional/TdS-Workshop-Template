        Our focus is the connection our talented volunteers and eager scholars develop, to provide a safe and inviting space for the facilitation of the learning experience in an environment that is both welcoming and stimulating also making sure to provide scholars with individuals that they can identify with which will help them envision themselves in that position in life as they navigate their environments on a day to day basis.  And also providing the opportunity to develop skills that they then can capitalize on immediately and start making money and continue to grow in sustainable career paths.  Volunteers will provide guidance on this journey through our apprenticeships and workshops; all the while developing mentor/mentee relationships in a natural way.
